# 🚀 Deep Narayan Banerjee  
**Rust & Kotlin Developer | Local-First Software | Privacy by Design**

I build software that respects both performance and simplicity.  
Rust shapes my systems work, Kotlin powers my Android apps, and JavaScript still has its place when I need clean, efficient web tooling.

## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I prefer tools that stay out of the user’s way.  
My focus stays on fast binaries, clean interfaces, and privacy-first approaches.  
I also handle Linux systems comfortably — from setup to maintenance across multiple machines.
